# 4.Wiretap the convo

- **1. What nets must you attach the logic analyzer to? (Check how the firmware sets up the UART in SerialConsole.c!)**
The pin configurations are defined by EDBG_CDC_SERCOM_PINMUX_PAD0 through EDBG_CDC_SERCOM_PINMUX_PAD3. These pins are used for the UART communication between the microcontroller and the computer.

- **2. Where on the circuit board can you attach / solder to?**

- **3. What are critical settings for the logic analyzer?**
